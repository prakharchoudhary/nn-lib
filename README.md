# NeuralNets
A collection of all commonly used deep learning layers and a few examples to use them. This is more or less a Deep Learning library implemented purely in Python. The goal is to understand the working of various layers and thus it is not omptimised for large training purposes(at least not yet!).

## Layers and functions to implement:
* - [x] Dense
* - [ ] Convolution 2D
* - [ ] Max Pooling
* - [ ] Average Pooling
* - [ ] Softmax Activation
* - [ ] ReLU Activation
* - [ ] Batch Normalization(regularisation)
* - [ ] Dropout
* - [ ] Xavier Initialization

## Examples:
* - [ ] A simple Neural Net trained on MNIST dataset
* - [ ] A convolutional Neural Net trained on CIFAR-10
