"""
This is a basic example used to train on MNIST dataset. The neural net
involves:
- 3 Dense Layers
- ReLU activation for hidden layers
- Sigmoid activation for output layer

TODO:
-----
- [] Make a utils file that can load mnist data into three different
sets: training, validation and testing.

- [x] Prepare the sequential network class to stack layers and allow training
and prediction.

- [] Remember to checkpoint the training as well as save model and weights at the end.

- [] Add tqdm based progress bar to show training and prediction progress.
